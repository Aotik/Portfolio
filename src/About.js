                Hi, I'm Stefan, a 23 year old Software Engineer based in Cyprus. I currently work at Overflow where I'm engineering the next
                generation user flow platform for designers.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                In my spare time, I primarily focus on UX/UI design. Having no formal education in design, studying tons of resources and
                projects over the past few years have given me an edge when starting new projects or jumping in to more complex projects.
